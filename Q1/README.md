1. If Team Rocket determines how to wake the sleeping giant and successfully steals the cache of Poké Balls that fills Coit Tower, about how many Poké Balls would they walk away with?

Having not been to Coit Tower yet, I want to approach this problem in two ways. One way is practically, and another way is mathematically.

Once Team Rocket have successfully gotten Snorlax to move, it all comes down to a question of whether they are literally or figuratively "walking away". What I mean by this is, are they actually going to pick up the pokeballs or transport it using a vehicle?

Given that Team Rocket is Team Rocket, and the mainstays of Jessie and James have been essentially shown to be successful at flying and nothing else, I would practically think they would either carry the pokeballs in their arms or utilize a vaccuum robot featured in one of the episodes of the anime. The capacity of this robot is no more than a few medium-sized pokemon, so the approximate maximum with this method is around 250 pokeballs given a pokeball's full-sized volume at 8.18 cubic inches. If Team Rocket is carrying Pokeballs out by the armful or bagfull, there couldn't be much more than 100 pokeballs that could be carried out.

Now, given that Team Rocket is suddenly and surprisingly smart, we can take a look at what they would do with some form of transportation and find things mathematically. A quick Google search indicates that the volume of a single pokeball is about 8.18 cubic inches (https://www.themarysue.com/pokeball-explanation/). Given that
